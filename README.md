## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi! I'm Josiah. I'm a 11 year old coder who loves to experiment with retro computers. I'm also the head dev of Jcode, my mod for Snap!

**Scroll down and see what programming languages I like to code in!**

1. HTML, JS, CSS, PHP (Web Develpment)
2. Python and Bash (Backend Develpment)
3. Swift, SwiftUI (iOS App Develpment)
4. [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), [Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu/) and [Jcode](https://jcode-official.neocities.org) (For fun =D)

I'm trying to learn Perl, but who cares? It's OUTDATED, Python is better! Sorry [Dad](https://github.com/pyn)!
