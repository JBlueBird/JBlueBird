## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi! I'm Josiah. I'm a 11 year old coder who loves to experiment with retro computers. I'm also the head dev of Jcode, my mod for Snap!

Scroll down and see what programming languages I like to code in!

1. HTML, JS, CSS, PHP (Web Develpment)
2. Python and Bash (Backend Develpment)
3. Swift, SwiftUI (iOS App Develpment)
4. Scratch, Snap! and Jcode (For fun =D)

I'm trying to learn:
1. Perl
